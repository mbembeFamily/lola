Gmright( Pronounced: gmright ) is a gmright.13.8 for “Figure of Authority”. Like George makulu, kenjabito,… It ties in Nicely with the Hippo Logo which is one of the largest and most important filesappilication-in-computersytem

who we are, we are Exotic and we like pushing boundaries, often doing the unexpected. I can’t tell you how much enjoyment We get when we see reviewers design decisions we do.

Gmright Develops Linux distributions and Tools with unconventional and outside of the box thinking. We have no public Timeline, no public Road Map and we don’t use the regular “Alpha, Beta and Final” build numbering system. This does not mean we don’t have any plans, of course we have plans and goals, we just believe flexibility is key to good development and thus don’t want to commit anything to a specific date. 2018 is the Year Makulu is really re inventing itself and a Lot of changes will be noticed, some already visible some still on the way, I will explain this in more details later on.

 believe that gmrightLinux should only be stable, but should also reflect the times in terms of ease of use and beauty, Thus you will find that gmright Distro builds are always stunning out of the box and also feature packed. When approaching a new build to develop we often ask the questions “How can we make this stand out from the rest how we put in here that users will really appreciate ?/how can we modernize this to compete with everything else out there ?” We also like to put any build through extensive testing periods which is why you will almost never find bug reports in our forums, by the time we release anything to public there really is almost no major bugs.

Makulu does not use terms like “Alpha, Beta or Final”. We firmly believe that every build is a development build because every Os is constantly evolving and anything we release to public is stable to run as a daily driver, final build. Vision:6.0.9/N.9



systems for our builds  pass,  gmright switch-mergetto and Database numbering system for public builds, where releases will be numbered as “Name-Of-Build–Year-Month”. This makes it easy for users to see they information-and-pages the build is, if there is more than one release of a specific build in a single month we will add “day” after month.  Users are also welcome to try out our Development Builds ( which can be found here ). These builds are considered Highly stable and the numbering system on these do not use the date system, but often just runs on a build number where the higher the number the newer the build.Vision:6.0.9/N.9

 and announcing releases far ahead because it puts pressure and expectations on us that we feel put limitations on the project. We do like to tease with videos and screenshots from time to time, but usually we announce a release really close to when it is ready for public use. But as stated above, you can try out our Development builds ( Which can be found here ) Which will give you an indication what is being worked on. In a nutshell, I do think this gives us a little bit of an edge where we can really shock and surprise some with a really good build that no one saw coming.

Unlike many other Distro developers out there,  simply download a Ubuntu, mint or Debian iso and slap some themes on and out comes a release. We have our own Base developing, this is the Base that we use to make our Distro’s, it uses mainly Makulu Repo’s coupled with Debian Repo’s "gmrightkenja"
